        <h1>Welcome to the iNaturalist Engagement Reporting Platform!</h1>

        <p>
            This platform, developed by the University of Florida’s Global Ecology Research Group, provides visual insights into engagement activity on iNaturalist. Engagement is tracked in two primary ways:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identifications</strong> – insights into how users contribute by identifying observations made by others.</li>
            <li><strong>Bioblitz Participation</strong> – insights into programming efforts that facilitate engagement through organized iNaturalist projects (e.g., bioblitzes).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to Use the Platform:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Identification Insights:</strong><br>
                Select the “Identifications” option and enter your iNaturalist username. The platform will generate a report showing your total number of identifications, the number of people you've engaged with, and a timeline of your identification activity.
                <em>Note: Graphics may take time depending on your activity level.</em>
            </li>
            <li><strong>For Bioblitz Insights:</strong><br>
                Select the “Bioblitz” option and enter the relevant project ID. The resulting report will show how the bioblitz contributed to observations and species in a specific place.
                <em>Note: Optimized for place-based bioblitzes.</em>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>To get started, choose which engagement graphic you'd like to view:</h3>

            <button onclick="location.href='/identifications/'">Identifications</button>
            <button onclick="location.href='/bioblitz/'">Bioblitz</button>
        </div>
